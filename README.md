# Fruit Based

fruit information webstite based on the Fruityvice API

## Please note i was not lucky enough to find a full solution for the Cors Error : 
## https://www.fruityvice.com/api/fruit/all from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

 I was able to atleast get the initial list of fruits on the main site and the filter functionality is working,
 however no luck for viewing fruit info and posting a new fruit which should work if a solution is found

# Steps

google chrome extension install : Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin

git clone <this repo>

npm install

npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
